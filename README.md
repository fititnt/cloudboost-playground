Here an important notice (the UI is not open source, but the core service is.)

> Important: Open Source CloudBoost only contains the API. If you're looking
for dashboard and the UI, we recommend using the managed service
[here](https://www.cloudboost.io/). We also have an enterprise offering for
enterprises where we have CloudBoost installed on your servers. Please
[reach out to us here](https://cloudboostio.typeform.com/to/Y4JOQD) if you're interested.
